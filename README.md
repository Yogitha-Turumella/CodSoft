Task 1 : NumberGuessingGame 
In the Number Guessing Game, a random number is generated within a specified range, such as 1 to 100. The user is prompted to guess the number, and feedback is provided on whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low. This process repeats until the user guesses correctly. The game can include additional features like limiting the number of attempts, offering multiple rounds, and displaying a score based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

Task 2 : StudentGradeGenerator
In the Student Grade Generator, the user inputs the names and scores of students for a particular exam or assignment. The program then calculates the corresponding grades based on a predefined grading scale. It displays each student's name, score, and grade. Additional features can include sorting the students by their scores, calculating the class average, and identifying the highest and lowest scores. This tool helps efficiently manage and analyze student performance data.

Task 3 : ATM Interface
In the ATM interface, an ATM machine class is created to manage user interactions. The user interface provides options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. Methods such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance() are implemented to handle these actions. A separate class represents the user's bank account, storing the account balance. The ATM class interacts with the bank account class to access and modify the balance. User input is validated to ensure transactions are within acceptable limits, such as having sufficient balance for withdrawals. Appropriate messages are displayed to the user based on their selected options and the outcome of their transactions.
